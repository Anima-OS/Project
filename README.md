# Anima

## Project

The evolution of computing in general and the web in particular has opened up software to new challenges but also opportunities. One challenge is portability, which is where modern browsers and common runtimes offer a solution.

One such product is Chrome OS. An operating system that grows at a staggering rate but lacks proper competition and comes with its own set of lock-in mechanisms.

Anima strives to be a modern, Go/HTML5 based operating system with the Linux kernel at its heart.

An alternative to Chrome OS. One that is completely open-source, easy to hack-on (in fact, the hope of introducing an entirely new generation of software developers to OS development is one of the pillars of this project) and highly customizable.

### What funding will go towards:

- Development
- Costs of infrastructure
- Bounties
- Promotional costs

### Initial goal (Anima v1):

- A clean base OS image with support for PWAs (Progressive Web Apps), a few basic (non-web) apps and proper sandboxing.
- Up-to-date online documentation of the development process.

### Goals in regards to Linux kernel development:

- The creation of a sustainable (soft) fork of the upstream Linux kernel.
- Replacing the Code of Conduct with a more sensible, technology-centric meritocratic oath. 
  The Code of Standards (https://anima-os.github.io/CoS/CODE_OF_STANDARDS)
- Investigating Rust integration, as well as the creation of a standardized kernel module toolkit (think IOKit/Driver Kit).

### Other sidegoals:

- Growing the number of available, multi-browser Webextension APIs.
- Providing upstream integration with Firefox (which Quokka, Anima's browser/runtime, is based upon).

### Why 10,000 euros? 

With a quasi competing initiative under the umbrella of the CoC Beacon, I thought it would be
interesting to see which project can reach a similar funding goal first. That being said, every little bit helps.
The project will definitely move forward though, even if it doesn't hit the mark. Open Source and OS development are my passion.
I've worked on this (as well as contributed to other projects) since 2013 now and am more than motivated to work on
this for the next 20-30 years.
