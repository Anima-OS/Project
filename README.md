Anima

A modern, Go/HTML5 based operating system with the Linux kernel at its heart.

# Project
Project Description for the likes of GoFundMe

### What any funding will go towards:

- Costs of infrastructure
- Bounties
- Promotion

### Goals in regards to Linux kernel development:

- The creation of a sustainable (soft) fork of the upstream Linux kernel.
- Replacing the Code of Conduct with a more sensible, technology-centric meritocratic oath. 
  The Code of Standards (https://anima-os.github.io/CoS/CODE_OF_STANDARDS)
- Investigating Rust integration as well as the creation of a standardized kernel module toolkit (think IOKit/Driver Kit).

Why 10,000 euros? With a quasi competing initiative under the umbrella of the CoC Beacon, I thought it would be
interesting to see which project can reach a similar funding goal first. That being said, every little bit helps.
The project will definitely move forward though, even if it doesn't hit the mark. Open Source and OS development are my passion.
I've worked on this (as well as contributed to other projects) since 2013 now and am more than motivated to work on
this for the next 20-30 years.
