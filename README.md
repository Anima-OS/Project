### Goals in regards to Linux kernel development:

- The creation of a sustainable (soft) fork of the upstream Linux kernel.
- Replacing the Code of Conduct with a more sensible, technology-centric meritocratic oath. 
  The Code of Standards (https://anima-os.github.io/CoS/CODE_OF_STANDARDS)
- Investigating Rust integration.

Why $10,000US? With a quasi competing initiative under the umbrella of the CoC Beacon, I thought it would be
interesting to see which project can reach its funding goal first. That being said, every little bit helps.
The project will definitely move forward though, even if it doesn't hit the mark. Open Source and OS development are my passion.
I've worked on this (as well as contributed to other projects) since 2013 now and am more than motivated to work on
this for the next 20-30 years.
